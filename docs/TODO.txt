This is a basic TODO list of some stuff that needs to be done.

As always, vim: set sts=2 sw=2 et : .

Also this document isn't actually Markdown.

- [ ] Make it possible to load and save boards.
      This will be in a text format as well, which should make it reasonably Git-friendly.
  - [ ] Add an incrementing ID counter for all entities.
  - [ ] Come up with a board file format.
  - [ ] Serialise (save) and deserialise a board state.
    - [ ] Serialise and deserialise entity continuations.
      - [ ] Add an incrementing ID counter for all script nodes.
      - [ ] Add a "de-tree'd script node" format.
      - [ ] Actually serialise and parse this stuff.
    - [ ] Serialise and deserialise everything else.

- [ ] Add layers to boards.
      While to some extent this is to cut down on entity spam, I do have every intention to have a floor layer.
  - [ ] Come up with a layer file format.
  - [ ] Add a floor layer.
  - [ ] Add a wall layer.
  - [ ] Add custom layer support and produce the following layers to demonstrate it:
    - [ ] Water layer
    - [ ] Forest layer?

- [x] Combine multiple boards into a world.

- [x] Entity reference type support.
  - [x] Add an entity reference type.
  - [x] Allow using these instead of a dir/pos in `send`.

- [x] Player script support.
  - [x] Add player script types.
  - [x] Send input events to the local player only, which then passes them onto their bound entity.

- [ ] Virtual FS support.
      This will also support the Actual FS, but the Virtual FS system will be used for that.
  - [x] ActualFS (R/W, random-access)
  - [ ] RamFS (R/W, random-access)
  - [ ] ZipFS (R/W, non-random-access archive)

- [ ] Replicate most ZZT entities to a reasonable degree.
      This is so we can prove that the scripting language is capable enough, and will also be useful for a standard library although there's a chance that a lot of it will be modified to be more intuitive.

  - [x] Player
  - [ ] Items:
    - [x] Ammo
    - [-] Torch
      - Probably not. I'm not that interested in emulating darkness.
    - [x] Gem
    - [x] Key
    - [x] Door
    - [-] Scroll
      - Provide your own entities for this.
    - [x] Passage
    - [-] Duplicator
      - This could be quite ugly. Better to spawn stuff cleanly.
    - [ ] Bomb
    - [ ] Energizer
    - [ ] Conveyor

  - [ ] Creatures
    - [ ] Bear
    - [ ] Ruffian
    - [-] Object
      - Provide your own entities for this.
      - I REFUSE TO EMULATE ZZT-OOP HERE DON'T ASK ME TO DO THIS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    - [ ] Slime
    - [ ] Shark
    - [ ] Spinning gun
    - [ ] Pusher
    - [x] Lion
    - [x] Tiger
    - [ ] Head
    - [ ] Segment

  - [ ] Terrain
    - [ ] Water
      - This would ideally be a water layer.
    - [ ] Forest
      - This would ideally be a forest layer.
    - [x] Breakable
    - [x] Boulder
    - [x] Sliderns
    - [x] Sliderew
    - [ ] Fake
      - I intend to have a floor layer, but if someone wants the "A fake wall - secret passage!" text then that can possibly be tracked on a layer by the player entity.
    - [x] Invisible
    - [ ] Blink wall
    - [ ] Transporter
    - [ ] Ricochet
    - [x] Various unbreakable walls which will probably be the same entity type and/or a wall layer:
      - [x] Solid
      - [x] Normal
      - [x] Line
      - [x] Text

  - [ ] Other
    - [-] Various hacks I probably won't be supporting:
      - [-] Edge
      - [-] Message timer
      - [-] Monitor
    - [ ] Star
    - [x] Bullet
    - [ ] Blink wall ray
      - This might end up being a layer.
