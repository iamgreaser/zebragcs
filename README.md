ZebraGCS: An ambitiously unambitious game creation system

by GreaseMonkey, 2021

Heavily inspired by ZZT and MegaZeux.

WARNING: This is highly experimental and quite incomplete and a lot of things are going to change.

Copyright stuff:

* `zebra/dat/ascii.chr` (the 8x14 EGA and possibly also MDA font) was ripped from MegaZeux and is only being used as a temporary measure while I work out which font I want and stuff like that. Potentially looking into using unscii, maybe funscii specifically.
* Everything else is licensed under a Zlib-style licence. See `LICENCE.zlib.txt` if you don't know what that is or have somehow forgotten.
